## 🚨 **Problem Solved**

The confusing payment structure has been fixed! Customers will no longer see large, confusing subscription amounts.

## 🔄 **What Changed**

### **Before (Confusing):**

- **Subscription Setup**: $2,469.12 (8 × $308.64) ⚠️ **CONFUSING!**
- **Monthly**: $308.64 each

### **After (Clear):**
- **Upfront**: $2,572.00 (full tuition) ✅ **CLEAR!**
- **Subscription Setup**: $205.76 (total admin fee) ✅ **SMALL!**
- **Monthly**: $25.72 each (admin fee ÷ 8) ✅ **REASONABLE!**

## 💰 **New Payment Structure**

### **Flexible Plan Example:**
- **Base Tuition**: $2,572.00
- **Admin Fee (8%)**: $205.76

### **Customer Experience:**
1. **Upfront Payment**: $2,572.00 (full tuition - clear and expected)
2. **Subscription**: $205.76 setup (small, manageable amount)
3. **Monthly Payments**: $25.72 each (reasonable admin fee installments)

## ✅ **Benefits**

1. **Clear Intent**: Upfront payment is clearly the tuition
2. **Small Subscription**: Only $205.76 setup (not $2,469.12)
3. **Reasonable Monthly**: $25.72 per month is manageable
